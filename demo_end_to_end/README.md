# Demo - End-to-end Git, RVM and Visual Studio Code exploitation

This is an end-to-end demo with exploits for Git, RVM and Visual Studio Code.

It simulates two different machines using Docker - a victim machine, and an
attacker machine. The attacker invites the victim to do a `git clone
--recursive` which exploits CVE-2018-17456 in an old version of Git. The victim
then uses `cd` to change directory to the cloned repository, triggering
CVE-2017-1000037 in an old version of RVM. Finally, the victim does `code .` to
view the code in Visual Studio Code, which triggers a vulnerability in an old
version of VSCode.

## Contents

* `up.sh` - does a `docker-compose up` to bring up the demo containers
* `attach.sh` - attaches several `tmux` panes to the demo containers
* `docker-compose.yml` - specifies how the demo containers should be brought up
* `image_attacker/` - specifies the attacker's Docker image
* `image_victim/` - specifies the victim's Docker image

## Dependencies

This demo does some awful things with `tmux` to attach to the demo containers
in a visually pleasing manner. You will need to have `tmux` installed, and you
will need to be comfortable with switching between `tmux` panes to run this
demo.

## Instructions

Review `up.sh` and `attach.sh` (and the rest of the files for good measure)

Run `up.sh`:

```
[justin@diablo ~/work/ides_of_march/demo_end_to_end]% ./up.sh
WARNING

The victim container will have SYS_PTRACE capability. This might allow for
container escape.

The victim container will have access to your host's X socket. This allows for
container escape.

Malicious code running in this container might try to escape to your host.
